# ocaml_toy_neural_networks

An OCaml implementation of automatic differentiation, some basic linear algebra, Newton's method, gradient descent and neural networks.

Trains a neural network to output an arbitrary boolean function as a demonstration.

Not comprehensive enough to be useful for anything serious.
